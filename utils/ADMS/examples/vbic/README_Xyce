Note:

The VBIC ".vla" files are actually not completely valid for use with a
real Verilog-A translator.  Specifically, they use "log" meaning
"natural logarithm" and this is NOT what "log" means in Verilog-A.
"log" means base-10 logarithm, and "ln" is natural logarithm.

Looking closely at all the ".c" and ".f" files, everywhere where the
Verilog-A has "log" the C has "log" as well --- meaning that their translator
did the substitution for them.

According to the VBIC web site, version 1.2.1 of the VBIC, which has
never been released, fixes this, and they do note that they had made
the substitution in translation.  Version 1.2.1 is listed as "being
finalized" on the VBIC web site, but this is years old.

So to use this VBIC model in Xyce's verilog translator, we'll have to
globally replace all uses of "log" with "ln" instead.  This is no big deal.

Note also that there are ".vcs" files that look like valid verilog,
but in fact are not complete, and have been processed in some way to
make the .vla files by expanding the defined macros and adding some 
variable declarations.  Trying to run adms over the .vcs file will not work.
