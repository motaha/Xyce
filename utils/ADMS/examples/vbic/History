VBIC Model History Notes

Release 1.2, Sep 18, 1999

	1.2 updates:	Sep 24, 1999
			3-terminal version defined
			base-emitter breakdown model added
			reach-through model added for B-C depletion capacitance
			homotopy version of code added
			limited exponential version added
			Completely new code generation added
			C, FORTRAN, Verilog-A, Perl, and MAST code provided
			Bug in psibi mapping with temperature fixed
			Bugs in electrothermal derivatives and solver stamp fixed
			DTEMP local temperature difference parameter added
			VERS and VREV (version revision) parameters added
			NKF high current beta rolloff parameter added
			Temperature dependence added to IKF

			Fixed collector-substrate capacitance added (CCSO)
			Separate temperature coeffs added for RCX, RBX, RBP
			tl node eliminated
			POLARITY OF SOME BRANCHES REVERSED FOR VERILOG-A COMPATIBILITY
			 > Ith  flows from dt to ground and so is negative
			 > Ixzf flows from xf1 to ground as so is negative of Itzf
			Igc component moved into Ibc
			Icc broken into forward and reverse components, Itxf or Itzf and Itzr

	1.1.5 updates:	Jul 28, 1996
			Dependence of Irbp on Vbci added to "branch currents"
			Itf/Itr renamed Itfi/Itri to avoid name conflicts
			Resistor collapse and code bypass condition
				changed from par==0 to par<=0
			Branch current and charge dependencies separated
				for self-heating and no self-heating
			Depletion charge and avalanche routines that provide
				derivatives for self-heating added
			Self-heating solver and examples added (HBT)
			Extra external node added for self-heating to allow
				coupling of thermal models between devices

	1.1.4 updates:	Qbe diffusion term made equivalent to SGP (divide by qb)
			Solver example including excess phase added
				(Icc separated into Itzf|Itxf and Itzr for this)
			Error in sgp_to_vbic in PTF to TD translation fixed

	1.1.3 updates:	Ith bug fixed and Igc term added
			BFN exponent added to 1/f noise
			RTH default changed to zero
			parameter aliases added

	1.1.2 updates:	EAI bug fixed in PE/PC/PStemperature mapping
			single->double precision in decomp/solve/vbict/QCDEPL
			scale changed to vscale in solver to avoid name conflict
			avalanche model added, element Igc
			initialization changed in solver
			AC solver and AC and temperature tests added
			missing term in derf_Vrci added
			potential numerical problem in Irci fixed

	1.1.1 updates:	VJ->V bug fixed in qj definition
			potential numerical problems with ITF fixed
			typo derf_Vcci fixed to derf_Vrci in FORTRAN code


Equivalent Circuit Network:

         |       |
-(->)-  (^) and (v)   are voltage controlled current sources (arrow gives
         |       |        reference direction for current flow), key letter I

+  -             | +
-||-        and  =    are voltage controlled charge sources (+/- signs
                 | -      give reference polarity), key ketter Q

-(=>)-                are current controlled flux sources (arrow gives
                          reference direction for flux), key letter F

o             are nodes

resistors are depicted as voltage controlled current sources for
generality (also, this is true if self-heating is modeled)
