The code in this directory was obtained from the Mextram Users Group web site
at http://mextram.sourceforge.net/index.html

For use with the Xyce verilog-a/ADMS interface, the *.va files were modified
so that the blocks that had formerly begun with:

  begin : initializeModel

now read: 
  @(initial_model) begin

In addition, evaluate.inc needed a newline at the end of the file in order
for ADMS to process it properly.  Other than that, the files here are exactly
as they were obtained from the MUG.
