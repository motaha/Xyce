Xyce Parallel Electronic Simulator 5.3 

By default, the serial version of this software is installed in the
/usr/local/Xyce-<version>/ directory. The parallel version is installed in
/usr/local/Xyce-OPENMPI-<version>/. Please consult the Installation Guide
if you wish the installation to have a different root directory.

From the chosen directory, the documentation will be in the doc
subdirectory, and the execution script (runxyce for serial or xmpirun
for parallel) will be in the bin subdirectory. The Installation Guide
and Users' Guide have instructions for creating links/shortcuts to
those files.
