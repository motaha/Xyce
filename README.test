To checkout and run the Xyce Test Suite:

1. Add the location of the executable you want to test to your path. 
   
2. Checkout the test suite (cvs -d :ext:joseki:/Net/Proj/Xyce/CVS checkout Xyce_Regression)
2a) If on the SRN and desiring the full test suite to include radiation models,
    check out the export controlled test cases, too:
    cd Xyce_Regression
    cvs -d :ext:charleston:/Net/Proj/Xyce/CVS checkout Xyce_SandiaRegression

3. To "automagically" run the test suite, cd to the TestScripts
directory and type run_xyce_regression.  As the script runs it will tell
you whether each test passed or failed, and if it passed how long the
run took in user and system time.  After the script completes, a
test_results."date" file will be placed in the Xyce_Test directory
(one level above the TestScripts directory).  This file lets you know
which tests failed.

Instead of putting the executable in your path, you can also provide a path
to it in the command line to run_xyce_regression.
